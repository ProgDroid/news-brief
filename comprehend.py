"""Comprehension: read captured items, decide which are material, extract.

Spec: docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-04-comprehension-pipeline-design.md

A supervisor job child, deliberately SEPARATE from capture. Capture must stay
continuous and cheap because feeds are windows and a missed item is gone
forever; comprehension can be lazy and batched because a captured item can be
reprocessed indefinitely. Concretely, an unbounded model call inside capture's
600s bound would trip the supervisor's overlap alert 48 times a day.

Nothing reads what this writes. entities/events/event_entities/assertions ship
QUARANTINED, per the rule Epic 1 converged on: quarantine is the default for an
unmeasured field, and measurement is what lifts it. The only thing that can say
whether this works is scripts/score_comprehension.py.
